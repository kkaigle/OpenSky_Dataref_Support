This tool uses Xlua to solve issues with some complex X-Plane aircraft that are largely coded outside of the default simulator. Because of this, the default datarefs are not always utilized by developers. This plugin with script solves that.

Installation instructions:

1. Download XLua from here: https://github.com/X-Plane/XLua 
2. Place Xlua in X-Plane 12\Resources\plugins\
3. Place the **engines** folder included in this repository into **xlua\scripts** folder

CREDIT to the developers involved and Laminar Research for providing this tool. https://github.com/X-Plane/XLua XLua XLua is a very simple Lua adapter plugin for X-Plane. It allows authors to create and modify commands and add create new datarefs for X-Plane aircraft.

XLua's functionality is in its core similar to Gizmo, SASL and FlyWithLua, but it is much smaller and has only a tiny fraction of these other plugn's functionality. The goals of XLua are simplicity, ease of use and to be light weight and minimal. XLua is meant to provide a small amount of "glue" to aircraft authors to connect art assets to the simulator itself.

XLua is developed internally by Laminar Research and is intended to help our internal art team, but anyone is free to use it, modify it, hack it, etc.; it is licensed under the MIT/X11 license and is thus Free and Open Source Software.

XLua is not meant to be an "official" Lua plugin for X-Plane, and it definitely does not replace any of the existing Lua plugins, all of which have significantly more features than XLua itself.
